| Version | Supported |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly using one of the two listed methods. Do **not** create an issue about any vulnerabilities.

In your chosen reporting method you should include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable)
- Any known workarounds

### Preferred Method

I prefer it if you [opened a GitHub security advisory](https://github.com/galvinpython/managedenv/security/advisories/new) (which is still private), instead of via email.

### Alternative Contact

If you do not wish to use GitHub, you may send an email to `imgalvin@pm.me` with the details of the issue

## Disclosure Policy

We follow [Coordinated Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_disclosure). We will:

1. Acknowledge receipt of the vulnerability report.
2. Investigate and confirm the issue.
3. Prepare and test a patch.
4. Release the fix and publish an advisory.
