# Security Policy

| Version | Supported |

<!-- For future reference -->
<!-- | 0.x     | ❌        | -->

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly using one of the two listed methods. Do **not** create an issue about any vulnerabilities.

In your chosen reporting method you should include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable)
- Any known workarounds

### Preferred Method

I prefer it if you [opened a GitHub security advisory](https://github.com/galvinpython/managedenv/security/advisories/new) (which is still private), instead of via email.

### Alternative Contact

If you do not wish to use GitHub, you may send an email to `imgalvin@pm.me` with the details of the issue
